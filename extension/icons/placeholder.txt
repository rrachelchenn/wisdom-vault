Please create the following icon files for the extension:

Suggested Design:

- Gold gradient (#FFD700 to #F59E0B)

You can use tools like Figma, Canva, or online icon generators.
Or use a placeholder from: https://icons8.com or https://flaticon.com

Quick placeholder (you can use a simple colored square for testing):
1. Create a simple 128x128 PNG with a gold star on dark background
2. Resize to 48x48 and 16x16

For development testing, you can create simple colored squares:
- Use any image editor to create gold (#FFD700) squares at each size
